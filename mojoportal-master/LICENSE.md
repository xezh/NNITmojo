## Current License
mojoPortal is primarily licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0 (EPL).

See the license-epl.txt file included in the licenses folder with the source code of mojoPortal or https://opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0

mojoPortal makes use of other open source projects that are licensed under other open source licenses which we believe to be compatible with the CPL. Some of these can also be found in the licenses folder with included in the source code package.

## License History

mojoPortal was licensed under the Common Plubic License (CPL-1.0) from inception until 10/23/2018. The following was borrowed from the jruby project. It describes the situation and reason for moving to the EPL. https://github.com/jruby/jruby/commit/330fef3b0fc18af477ccea19bd278669667f31bb

Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without re-contacting past contributors.

The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All other language in the license remains identical.

Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:

Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling. With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the move.
