<p>Markup Definitions are the most important setting option in SuperFlexi, they determine what kind of items you’ll be adding to the SuperFlexi instance, whether it will be a slider or a simple list of links or icon blocks, this will not only change what options you have on the items you create, but how they will look and what other code might be applied to them (JS for a slider, for instance).</p>
