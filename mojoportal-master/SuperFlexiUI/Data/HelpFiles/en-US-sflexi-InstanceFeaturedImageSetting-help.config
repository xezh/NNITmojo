<p>This setting allows you to set a module-wide image. Note that only some Markup Definition types will use this at all. If setting this does nothing, then your Markup Definition doesn’t need it, and you should work on setting your images inside the SuperFlexi items instead (via an “edit” link rather than the “settings” link).</p>
