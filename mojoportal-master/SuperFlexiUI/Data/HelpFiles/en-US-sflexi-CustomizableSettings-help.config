<p>The value of this input will be created as a token (reference: $_CustomSettings_$) and passed to your Markup Definition for your use in whatever way you want. Most Markup Definitions don’t use this, but if you have one that does you will probably need to pass in settings options to this field for it to work. If you don’t know what any of this means, ignore it.</p>
