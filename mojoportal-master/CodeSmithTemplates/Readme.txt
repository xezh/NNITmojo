Most of the templates for version 4.x of Codesmith can also be used in the freeware Codesmith 2.6.
In the few cases where we have found this not to be true we have created special versions of the templates for the freeware version.

You can download the older freeware version of Codesmith from here:

http://www.codesmithtools.com/freeware.aspx

but I highly recommend purchasing a newer version
