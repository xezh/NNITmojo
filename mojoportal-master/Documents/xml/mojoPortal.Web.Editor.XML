            <summary>
            This option enables you to auto focus an editor instance. The 
            value of this option should be an editor instance id. Editor 
            instance ids are specified as "mce_editor_index", where 
            index is a value starting from 0. So if there are 3 editor 
            instances on a page, they would have the following 
            ids - mce_editor_0, mce_editor_1 and mce_editor_2.

            This option specifies the default writing direction, some languages 
            (Like Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu...) write from right to left instead 
            of left to right. The default value of this option is "ltr" but 
            if you want to use from right to left mode specify "rtl" instead.

            <summary>
            This option enables you to specify a custom CSS file that extends 
            the theme content CSS. This CSS file is the one used within the 
            editor (the editable area). The default location of this CSS file 
            is within the current theme. This option can also be a comma 
            separated list of URLs.
