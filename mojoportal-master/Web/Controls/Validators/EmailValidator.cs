    /// this one seems to have a performance problem on server validation for some inputs, a known example input that hangs the registration 
    /// page and spikes cpu usage is patriciarichards5395@yahoo.comgetgoing (which is technically a valid email address format even if it isn't a real email address)
    /// others I tested did not have the performance problem but return invalid for emails like foo+test@foo.com which should be valid.
    /// False negatives like that are a worse problem but performance issues are also a major problem because they could be used for denial of service
    /// or attempts to overload the server.
